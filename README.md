# HTML/CSS Examples

This repository contains some simple examples of websites creating using HTML and CSS. These sites were created using reference designs that can be found in the "Reference" directory within each Example directory (e.g. [Example 1/Reference](https://github.com/HelenaAvis/HTML-CSS-Examples/tree/readme/Example%201/Reference)).
